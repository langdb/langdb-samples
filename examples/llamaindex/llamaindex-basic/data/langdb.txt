Introduction to AI Gateway
Unified API for all LLMs

LangDB provides OpenAI compatible APIs to connect with multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) by just changing two lines of code.
Features:
Provide access to all major LLMs
Ensure seamless integration with leading large language models to maximize flexibility and power.

No framework code required
Enable plug-and-play functionality using any framework like Langchain, Vercel AI SDK, CrewAI, etc., for easy adoption.

Plug & Play Tracing & Cost Optimization
Simplify implementation of tracing and cost optimization features, ensuring streamlined operations.

Automatic routing based on cost, quality, and other variables
Dynamically route requests to the most suitable LLM based on predefined parameters.

Benchmark and provide insights
Deliver insights into the best-performing models for specific tasks, such as coding or reasoning, to enhance decision-making.

Roadmap
Open Source AI Gateway (In Progress)
Open-source AI Gateway for community collaboration and transparency. Built in Rust.

Prompt Caching & Optimization (In Progress)
Introduce caching mechanisms to optimize prompt usage and reduce redundant costs.

GuardRails (In Progress)
Implement safeguards to enhance reliability and accuracy in AI outputs.

Leaderboard of models per category
Create a comparative leaderboard to highlight model performance across categories.

Ready-to-use evaluations for non-data scientists
Provide accessible evaluation tools for users without a data science background.

Readily fine-tunable data based on usage
Offer pre-configured datasets tailored for fine-tuning, enabling customized improvements with ease.
